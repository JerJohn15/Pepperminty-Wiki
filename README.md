Pepperminty-Wiki
================
A wiki in a box

Pepperminty wiki is a complete wiki in a box inspired by @am2064's Minty wiki, which can be found here: https://github.com/am2064/Minty-Wiki

Downloading / Installing
------------------------
All you need to do is download `index.php` in this repository and put it in a folder on your web server. You need to make sure that PHP can write to that folder though. However, you can deny write access to the file itself since there is no automatic updating function built in yet.

If you prefer, you can clone this repository or use the "Download Zip" button to the right.

Configuring
-----------
To configure it, open your downloaded copy of `index.php` in your favourite editor - the settings can be configured at the top of the file. There are extensive comments that explain what each option does. Make sure that you change the allowed usernames and passwords! If you need more help, don't hesitate to open an issue on this repository or contact me.

Themes (aka strings of CSS)
---------------------------
Wanted: Themes! If you have a cool theme, simply open an issue on the bug tracker in this repository to share your theme. If you don't have a github account, no problem! Simply email me with your code instead.
